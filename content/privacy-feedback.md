## Feedback Data Collection

When you submit feedback through our documentation site, we collect:

- **Page URL and title** - To understand which page your feedback relates to
- **Your feedback text** - The content you write in the form
- **Submission timestamp** - When you sent the feedback

### What we do NOT collect

- Your name or email address
- Personal identification information
- Browser or device information (beyond basic request headers)

### How we use your feedback

Your feedback is stored as a GitHub Issue in a private repository accessible only to course administrators. We use this feedback to:

- Fix errors in the documentation
- Improve clarity of instructions
- Add missing information
- Enhance the overall learning experience

### Data retention

Feedback is retained for the duration of the course and may be archived afterward for course improvement purposes.

### Your rights

As this is anonymous feedback, we cannot identify or retrieve specific submissions. If you need to provide identifiable feedback or have specific data requests, please contact the course administration directly.
