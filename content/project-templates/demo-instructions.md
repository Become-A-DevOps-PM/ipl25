On Fridays you will present a demo of your work. You do this in groups.

## What to Show

A demo should present the system itself - how it looks and how it functions. It's important that it works, but early on the functionality will naturally be limited.

Create a clear picture of what has been done since last week and what remains. This helps the audience understand where to provide constructive feedback and which parts are not yet implemented.

A graphical user interface is relatively easy to present and give feedback on. More challenging is presenting the underlying parts that deal with quality attributes such as security, performance, scalability, and maintainability. It is often appreciated to include an "Under the Hood" section that explains what's happening behind the scenes.

## Retrospective Highlights

Consider sharing insights from your retrospective:

- Key decisions you made and why
- What surprised you or was more challenging than expected
- What you would do differently

## Feedback

Be explicit about what kind of feedback you are looking for. Help your audience know where to focus their input - whether it's on functionality, architecture, approach, or something else entirely.

## Cost Awareness

As a project manager you normally need to track time and cost. While this is usually done more formally in a status report, try to give an indication during your demo of how things are progressing and whether the solution you're presenting is cost-effective.

Think about cost from two perspectives:

1. **One-time cost** - the development effort in the project
2. **Runtime cost** - the ongoing cost when the system is in operation

Good luck!
